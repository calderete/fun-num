#Fun-Num

This application will as the name suggests do fun stuff with numbers. Initially it will handle measurment conversions and then I will move onto more complicated tasks such as testing for "happy numbers" or calculating the "Levenshtein distance" between two strings. You can see the app here <a href="https://polar-dusk-33124.herokuapp.com">FunNum</a>
