#Fun-Num

This application will as the name suggests do fun stuff with numbers. Initially it will handle measurment conversions and then I will move onto more complicated tasks such as testing for "happy numbers" or calculating the "Levenshtein distance" between two strings.

## Purpose

The development of this application will be an excercise for me in TDD as well as solving data problems and detecting patterns in incoming data. I also plan to use this app as an excercise for me to develop my UI skills.
